- fix coverage
- fix cancel

- Serious memory leak the more tests run. Is memory not getting cleared?

- UI
    - coverage for file to show counts and highlight on hover
    - get rid of flicker from when settings is open and change project

- export project
    - in remote package, add install(npm i actually installs into equipt directory) and start scripts so you can run without the app

- visual recorder test maker?
    - start server
    - open iframe
    - record actions

- Would be so cool if it could also help write docs

- record test frame x frame to watch stack(via nyc instrumenting)
