- get rid of flicker from when settings is open and change project

- view logs(for unuseful errors)

- project init
    - in remote package, add install(npm i actually installs into equipt directory) and start scripts so you can run without the app
    - create jasmine config?

- run project
    - cancel tests runner (child.pause();child.kill())

- visual recorder test maker?
    - start server
    - open iframe
    - record actions

- Would be so cool if it could also help write docs

- delete test result
