- hmm... coverage needs the app to restart?
    - seems to be fine in the code visual (i.e. 2x line 2)
    - I think it's actually coming from client side as the reports actually look to be correct
    - grumble, don't think so, but maybe it's getting it wrong on server, buuuut lines array IS correct
    - ok, coverage-summary is bullshit, go off of .nyc_potput

- instead of progress bar, do progress bar with stndin messages, minimize parsing

=================================================
LATER ENHANCMENTS
=================================================

- UI
    - coverage for file to show counts and highlight on hover
    - get rid of flicker from when settings is open and change project
    - view logs(for unuseful errors)
    - cancel tests runner (child.pause();child.kill())
    - delete test result

- export project
    - in remote package, add install(npm i actually installs into equipt directory) and start scripts so you can run without the app

- visual recorder test maker?
    - start server
    - open iframe
    - record actions

- Would be so cool if it could also help write docs

- record test frame x frame to watch stack(via nyc instrumenting)
